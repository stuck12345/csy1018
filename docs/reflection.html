     <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF LEARNING WEB DEVELOPMENT</u></h2>
    <p>
    	I will say my first week was like a new born baby. I found Web Development is interested subject that is started to introduce me in the new platform of my life. In the second week, I started to learn HTML5 that was bit ugly without CSS, but I found my code in URL that was very fascinating. However, there was Codepen.io that is very good place to know share your code, practice with code and fork code. Obviously, I will say I learn commenting and use other code in this section. As well as I installed my first code editor on that week that is namely Visual code studio.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In week three, there were lot of topics that were namely using Slack, HTML5 Semantic Element, Attribute, Review HTML page structure, CSS Syntax, The link element, Google Font API, List element type, W3C Validator and Preview Chrome Dev tools. That was really a lot of work on that week, but it was quite fine because of new experience in new material. Obviously, Slack was very interesting place where I found all my class friends. Moreover, the next week, I learned how to do ‘Box Model’, Navigation, Intro to layout, Croome Dev Tools and Material Design. I found Material Design is the most interesting site where I was able to see many tools that I can use in my Web site. However, Flexbox was introducing in the 5th week as well as Media Queries that were most important for this term Assignment and I have seen that this is the new material that is using in the HTML and CSS to build better Web site that before. Anyway, using photoshop is interesting that help me to optimise image in my assignment in week six. In week eight, Liz taught us Glassdoor, Microinteractions, Underlying grid and HTML5 Video. I will say week nine was most interesting when Liz gave us a toy as a best of luck. Hahaha. I am smiling. Anyway, I learnt set up site in GitHub. In addition, in the following week I learnt accessibility and Usability that we can use to prove that our colour in CSS is accessible and usable. In addition, I learnt Google Maps API, Icons, Favicons and Forms.The fascinating things are researching many sites in my first experience that is very tremendous learning as a basic web developer. I will say Liz makes all the material comfortable for us that increase my confidence to learn web development. This semester is great with new friends as I have got many good web developer friends who are very supportive and helpful and who wants to always friendly and do like to spend time together. In addition, the university is really great because they are trying their best to support students all around the world and as an international student, I will say it is giving me best service that I am even not expecting.
